Dear fellow open-source enthusiasts,

We are excited to announce the launch of our new project, the Passwords directory. This directory will be a collection of password lists that can be used by various tools for password guessing and credential cracking purposes.

We believe that having a central repository of password lists will greatly benefit the security community and improve the effectiveness of password cracking tools. The directory will be constantly updated and curated by our team of experts, ensuring that the lists are current and relevant.

We are inviting everyone to contribute to this project by submitting their own password lists to the directory. Your contributions will help make the Passwords directory a valuable resource for the security community.

If you are interested in contributing, please visit our website and follow the instructions on how to submit your password lists. We greatly appreciate your support and look forward to seeing the Passwords directory grow with the help of the community.



The Passwords directory team.
